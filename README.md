## Description
<p align="left"> 
  A multi-classification NLP project with multiple neural networks used for comparison. Link to dataset is <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amananandrai/ag-news-classification-dataset">here</a>.
  The code is <b><i>HEAVILY</i></b> commented with great detail in every section to ensure reader understands as much of the code as possible. Additionally, 
  two neural network models, with specific layers, are created to tackle this project: 

  - Embedding
  - Embedding Bag

  Both approaches explained very well and results documented with matplotlib. Project sections are broken down into:
  1) Exploratory Data Analysis
     - Exploring word usage
     - Stop words
  2) Tokenization
  3) Vocab
  4) Batches
  5) Model Building
  6) Get model training ready
     - Creating testing function
     - Training model
  7) Model evaluation
  8) Embedding model comparison
     - Embedding model building
     - Embedding model training function
     - Data loaders and test function
     - Embedding model training
  9) Model evaluation comparison

NLP is my passion and I'm always working at it. Hope this project can help someone out there understand a thing or two about NLP.
